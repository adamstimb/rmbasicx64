/*
Package nimgobus is RM Nimbus-inspired Ebiten extension for building building retro apps and games in Go.  It
mimicks the 16-bit graphics and text drivers of the RM Nimbus PC186, found in classrooms all
over the UK in the 1980s and early 90s.

With Nimgobus you can develop Go applications that have the cheesey and often 'chromatically
challenging' look and feel of classic Nimbus software such as PaintSPA, Ourfacts and Caxton
Press.

Nimgobus is a tribute project and is in no way linked to or endorsed by RM plc.
